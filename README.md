This is a mini-project from The Odin Project.

The goal is to create a rock-paper-scissors game.

The user chooses from rock, paper, or scissors via text input; the computer makes its choice randomly.

The program then compares the two, decides a winner, and displays the result to the user.

5 rounds are played, after which a winner is declared.

User input is case insensitive.
